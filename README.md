##Browser Lights Out game.  For fun and practice with html/css/js/jq.

Self-directed project, not from a website/book.  Mostly done, but...nothing is ever really done.

####Future work:
* Better looking visuals: maybe imgs for the lights, fancy css/jq visual stuff, UI redesign
* Responsive/fluid display (esp font sizes)
* general refactoring/polishing of code
