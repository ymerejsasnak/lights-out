lights-out
==========

Browser Lights Out game.  For fun and practice with html/css/js/jQ.
<br>
<br>
Need to implement:<br>
-game completed detector<br>
Optional stuff to add later:<br>
-keep count of moves<br>
-option to have randomized start position<br>
-customizable grid size<br>
-3 states mode (2 different 'on's and one 'off')<br>

<br>
<br>
after some research learned that any size square IS solvable (From all on to all off)<br>
in order for a randomized board to work, start with a regular all on board, then randomly toggle cells to acheive a random start position<br>
three states is also solvable<br>
