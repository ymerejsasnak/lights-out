lights-out
==========

Browser Lights Out game.  For fun and practice with html/css/js/jq
<br>
Need to work on responsiveness of display!  especially font sizes!
<br>
Optional stuff to add later:<br>
-change shape to X rather than +<br>
-customizable grid size (will have to set the size of cells from js for this I think) [tricky on the css side mostly]<br>


<br>
<br>
-after some research learned that any size square IS solvable (From all on to all off)<br>
-in order for a randomized board to work, start with a regular all on board, then randomly toggle cells to acheive a random start position<br>
-three states is also solvable<br>
